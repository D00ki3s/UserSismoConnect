### Launch your local fork by forking Mumbai with Anvil

In a new terminal:

```bash
# start a local blockchain with mumbai fork
yarn anvil
# this triggers this anvil command behind the scene
# `anvil --fork-url https://rpc.ankr.com/polygon_mumbai`
```

### Start your local Next.js app

In a new terminal:

```bash
# this will start your Next.js app
# the frontend is available on http://localhost:3000/
# it deploys the contracts on the local blockchain
yarn dev
```

The frontend is now available on http://localhost:3000/ and the contracts have been deployed on your local blockchain.
You can now experiment the user flow by going to your local frontend http://localhost:3000/.
If you wish to see the frontend code, you can go to the src/pages folder. The contracts code is in the contracts folder.

### Clone the repository

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/D00ki3s/user-backend
cd user-sismo-connect
```

### Start your local Next.js app

In a new terminal:

```bash

### Generate your personalized and private cookie

As you will see, the app showcase a simple process to generate a personalized and private cookie with Sismo Connect.
To generate a cookie, in a developer mode, you just need to add your address in [`./config.ts`](./config.ts):

```ts
// Replace with your address to become member of existing groups. 
export const yourAddress = "0x855193BCbdbD346B423FA830b507CBf90ecCc90B"; // <--- Replace with your address

...
```

After changing the config file, you don't need to restart the app nor restart anvil, just refresh the page on the frontend and you are good to go.

ℹ️ You will be able to regenerate and change your cooke as many times as you wish.

```
